                    <p>Flexibility<br><br>
                        One of my greatest strengths that I have recognized would have to be my ability to be a flexible ans versatile in any circumstances. I discover that skill while dealing with uncertain, unpredictable work situation , where ability of solving problems creatively and adapting to novel situations or dynamic situations are very essential. Moreover, I believe that flexibility helps in any kind of workplace.  Nowadays, being flexible with employees is good for business. It builds employee trust and commitment, helps attract and keep key talent, as well as drives everyone to find solutions that work for all those involved.
                        <br><br>
                        Stress resistance<br><br>
                        It is important to note that my stress tolerance is quiet high, which I practically improved. In view of the fact that studying at university sometimes refers to being under the pressure because of the difficulties of subjects, preparing for the exams and etc. Furthermore, it need to be said that employers seek for those workers who can maintain effective performance under pressure or adversity. There are many jobs that require a candidate to be able to work under pressure and who is able to cope with different levels of stress. Moreover, stress tolerance is extremely helps in communication with co-workers and solving any kind of problems at work.
                        <br><br>
                        Teamwork<br><br>
                        As a matter of fact, my teamwork skills developed from my childhood. Nevertheless, its improved by doing group presentations, assignments with my groupmates. I believe that, having teams can result in faster and efficient outputs with better decision making skills. “Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success”(Ford, 1923). Comparatively, there are various advantages of teamwork for career development. For instance, It improves profitability as well as productivity as all the employees are highly motivated and skilled. A business or cooperation will not survive unless all members work as one team. Accordingly, people all want to be successful in their working as it also brings happiness to them. To do this, there are considerable numbers of skills which they need to have. There are several learning outcomes that I gained from different modules during study foundation year at university. Those outcomes helped me identify my academic and personal skills, which I’m going to improve during year 2 and year 3. Furthermore those skills provide the basic foundation to get, keep and progress on a job and to achieve the best results.</p>
